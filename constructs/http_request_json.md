# Making HTTP Requests and Visually Selecting JSON Paths

Making a request to a site and parsing the json response from the site is a common constructs in playbooks. To make this process easier, I've created an [app](http://playbooks.hightower.space/requester) that lets you request the content from a website and visually create JSON mappings. It then creates a playbook for you that contains the correct "HTTP Client" and "JSON Path" apps with all of the mappings you created.

Try it out: [http://playbooks.hightower.space/requester](http://playbooks.hightower.space/requester)!
