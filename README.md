# ThreatConnect Playbook Paradigms and Constructs

A collection of paradigms and constructs for building [playbooks](http://kb.threatconnect.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2744775-playbooks) in [ThreatConnect](https://app.threatconnect.com).

This is currently a living document and should not, by any means, be considered canon. These are just helpful tips and hints that will help you build more robust, effective, and maintainable Playbooks. Available as a gitbook here: [https://pb-constructs.hightower.space/playbooks/](https://pb-constructs.hightower.space/playbooks/).

Enjoy,
